# ‚ú® Description of Program üìù
This project focuses on developing an e-commerce website dedicated to the buying and selling of preloved clothing items. The platform aims to contribute to sustainable fashion by encouraging the reuse and recycling of apparel and accessories. Inspired by major e-commerce platforms like Shopee, Lazada and Carousell, the website is designed to offer a user-friendly shopping experience while promoting environmentally conscious consumer behavior. The initiative aligns with Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 12, particularly Target 12.5, which focuses on substantially reducing waste generation through prevention, reduction, recycling, and reuse.

## ‚ú® Core Features‚ö°
The website organizes its offerings into four main categories to ensure inclusivity and variety. The Men‚Äôs category features preloved clothing items such as t-shirt, hoodie, pants, and jeans. The Women‚Äôs category includes second-hand apparel such as dresses, long skirts, tops, blouses, pants, and jackets. For children, the Kids category offers a curated selection of preloved clothing such as trousers, dresses and shirts catering to the needs of parents seeking sustainable options. Additionally, the Accessories category provides a range of products such as sling bags, sunglasses, baseball caps, watches, and glasses frames for all genders.

## ‚ú® Sustainability Focus üöÄ
The primary goal of this project is to support SDG 12 by promoting sustainable consumption and production patterns. By encouraging the purchase of preloved items, the platform reduces the demand for new clothing production, thereby lowering textile waste and conserving natural resources. This initiative directly supports Target 12.5, which aims to substantially reduce waste generation through prevention, reduction, recycling, and reuse. The platform empowers users to embrace eco-friendly practices by extending the lifecycle of clothing and accessories, thus fostering a culture of sustainability.

## ‚ú® Inspiration and Design üåç
Drawing inspiration from the seamless functionality and accessibility of major e-commerce platforms like Shopee and Lazada, this project integrates a robust and user-friendly interface tailored to second-hand shopping. The platform has been carefully designed to include essential e-commerce features that ensure a smooth and secure shopping experience, catering to both users and administrators.
For users, the website offers a straightforward Sign Up and Sign In process to enable account creation and personalized access. In the event of forgotten credentials, the Forgot Password feature allows users to recover their accounts easily, while the Change Password option ensures they can update their credentials as needed. To enhance the shopping experience, the platform includes a powerful Search engine and product Filters to help users quickly find items based on categories, price, condition, and more. Additionally, users can manage their selections through a Cart and Checkout system, where they can add items, review their choices, and proceed with seamless payments through integrated secure gateways. The platform also features Order Management, allowing users to track their orders and view their purchase history.
Administrators are provided with a secure Admin Sign In portal, enabling them to oversee and manage the platform effectively. The admin panel includes the ability to View and Manage Products, which allows administrators to add new items, update product details, or remove outdated items from the catalog. Additionally, the system facilitates Product Storage and Data Management, ensuring efficient handling of inventory, product descriptions, and images. To support the financial aspects of the platform, Order Calculations are automated, enabling the system to compute totals, discounts, and other metrics accurately.
